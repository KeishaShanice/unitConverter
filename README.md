<h2>How It's Made:</h2>
<p>Technologies used include HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>

<h3>In Action:</h3>
<p>User will insert a number into the text-field either using a keypad or using the up/down buttons in the text-field. After inserting the number, user can click the "Convert" button to generate length, volume, and mass conversions for the inserted number. Results will display in both Metric and Imperial measurement types. User can click "Go Dark" to switch to and from Dark Mode.</p>

<h2>Optimizations:</h2>
<p>In addition to project requirements, I included an option to change color settings to/from light to dark.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
